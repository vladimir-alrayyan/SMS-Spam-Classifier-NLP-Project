# SMS Spam Classifier - NLP Project

## Overview
This project classifies SMS messages as 'spam' or 'ham' using machine learning and NLP techniques.  
Dataset: SMS Spam Collection (UCI ML Repository).

## Workflow
- Data loading & exploration
- Text preprocessing
- Feature engineering (TF-IDF)
- Model training (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation and comparison
- Prediction demo

## Results
- Best model: Random Forest (highest accuracy and recall for spam)
- Includes confusion matrices and classification reports

## How to Run
- Open this notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
- Run through each cell step-by-step.
- Use `predict_spam(message)` function for new SMS predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn
